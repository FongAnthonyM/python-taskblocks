""" arrayqueue.py
A queue for sending numpy ndarrays and other objects to other processes.

This queue extends an AsyncQueue with handling ndarrays. A ndarray can take a large amount of memory and default
queues create a pickle copy of the array to enqueue, which is slow and takes up diskspace. To be faster and prevent
large disk read-writes, this queue instead passes SharedMemory containing the arrays to other processes.

When a ndarrays is passed directly to into the "put" methods, a copy of the array is created in SharedMemory and,
with its "get" handling instructions, it is serialized into an ArrayQueueItem, which will be put into the queue.

An ArrayQueueItem consist of the SharedMemory of the array (SharedArray), a boolean for if it will be copied into a
normal ndarray when "get" from the queue, a boolean for if the SharedArray will be deleted from memory when "get"
from the queue, and a boolean for if the ArrayQueueItem will be returned instead.

Instead of passing a ndarray, other objects can be passed to control how the array is handled in the "get" method.
When a SharedArray is passed the SharedArray is returned from the "get" method without copying or deleting.
Alternatively, an ArrayQueueItem can be passed directly for user defined control over the "get" handling. Lastly, a
tuple of objects can be passed to the "put" methods which will serialized all objects recursively and that the tuple
of serialized objects will be put into the queue. Also, any objects of other types can be passed into the "put"
methods or serialization as well, but they will put into the queue normally with any special handling.
